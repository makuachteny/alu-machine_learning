### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

RNNs are neural networks designed for sequential data, where each output depends on previous computations. They have a "memory" that retains information from past inputs, enabling dynamic temporal behavior.

**Common applications:**
- Language modeling
- Machine translation
- Speech recognition
- Image captioning
- Time series prediction

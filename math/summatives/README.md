# Optimization Using Gradient Descent: Linear Regression

In this assignment, you will build a simple linear regression model to predict sales based on TV marketing expenses. You will investigate three different approaches to this problem: using `NumPy` and `Scikit-Learn` linear regression models, as well as constructing and optimizing the sum of squares cost function with gradient descent from scratch.

Fast API endpoint:
To integrate the linear regression model with FastAPI for predictions, follow the provided code snippet:

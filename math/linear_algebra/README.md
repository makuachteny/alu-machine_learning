## Project 1: Matrix Operations

In this project, we explore various matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transposition. We implement these operations using Python and NumPy library.

## Project 2: Linear Regression

In this project, we apply linear algebra concepts to implement a simple linear regression model. We use matrix multiplication and inverse operations to calculate the regression coefficients.

## Project 3: Principal Component Analysis

In this project, we use linear algebra techniques to perform principal component analysis (PCA). We apply matrix decomposition methods to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and extract the most important features.

## Project 4: Singular Value Decomposition

In this project, we explore singular value decomposition (SVD) and its applications in machine learning. We use SVD to perform dimensionality reduction, image compression, and collaborative filtering.

## Project 5: Eigenvalue and Eigenvector

In this project, we study eigenvalues and eigenvectors and their significance in linear algebra and machine learning. We implement algorithms to calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices.

Feel free to explore each project and learn more about the intersection of linear algebra and machine learning!
